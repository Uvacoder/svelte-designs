      What is this? Well, me and
      <a href="https://github.com/nikarashihatsu/">my friend</a>
      are doing this challenge where we try to implement 3 designs each week
      into code. Feel free to submit your design to us btw.
      <br />
      Why is it called
      <span class="highlight">Three of &lbrace;Some, Every&rbrace;thing</span>?
      It came up by accident actually. The first time I make the repo for this
      challenge on github, I don't know what to name it. So I was thinking,
      because we implement 3 designs each week, I want the word "three" for its
      name. Being me who isn't really good at naming stuff so I just went with
      <span class="highlight">Three of Something</span>. Then a few moments
      later, my friend made his repo called
      <span class="highlight">Three of Everything</span>. If we combine those,
      we'll get
      <span class="highlight">Three of &lbrace;Some,Every&rbrace;thing</span>.
      And yes, that's BASH expansion braces.
      <br />
      UPDATE: One of
      <a href="https://github.com/LynSotera/">my friend</a>
      joined, and now it became
      <span class="highlight">Three of &lbrace;Some,Every,No&rbrace;thing</span>
