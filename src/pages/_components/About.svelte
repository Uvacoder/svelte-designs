      What is this? Well, me and <a href="https://github.com/nikarashihatsu/">my
        friend</a> are doing this challenge where we try to implement 3 designs each
      week into code. Feel free to submit your design to us btw. <br /> Why is it
      called <span class="highlight">"Three of &lbrace;Some,Every&rbrace;thing"</span>?
      It came up by accident actually. The first time I make the repo for this
      challenge on github, I don't know what to name it. So I was thinking,
      because we implement 3 designs each week, I want the word "three" for its
      name. Being me who isn't really good at naming stuff so I just went with <span
        class="highlight"
      >Three of Something</span>. Then a few moments later, my friend made his
      repo called <span class="highlight">Three of Everything</span>. If we
      combine those, we'll get <span class="highlight">Three of
        &lbrace;Some,Every&rbrace;thing</span>. And yes, that's BASH expansion
      braces. <br/> UPDATE: One of <a href="https://github.com/LynSotera/">my friend</a>
      joined, and now it became <span class="highlight">Three of
        &lbrace;Some,Every,No&rbrace;thing</span>
