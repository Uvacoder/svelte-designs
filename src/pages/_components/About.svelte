      What is this? Well, me and
      <a href="https://github.com/nikarashihatsu/">my friend</a>
      are doing this amazing challenge, where each one of us try to implement
      three designs each week into code. You can also submit your design to us!
      <br />

      Why is it called
      <span class="highlight">Three of &lbrace;Some, Every&rbrace;thing</span>?
      It came up by accident actually. When I created the project repo, I've
      named it Three Of Something, since we are implementing three designs, then
      at the same time my friend creates another repo and called Three Of
      Everything. So we agreed why not just combine those :D We end up with
      <span class="highlight">Three of &lbrace;Some,Every&rbrace;thing</span>.
      &lt;And yes, that's BASH expansion braces.&rt;
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>UPDATE:</strong>
      One of my friend joined, and now it became Three of
      <span class="highlight">Three of &lbrace;Some, Every, No&rbace;thing</span>
      <br />
      <strong>ANOTHER UPDATE:</strong>
      I didn't have much time now so I just decided to implement one design each
      week.
